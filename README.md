### [Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Mall_Customer_Segmentationt.ipynb)

Utilized KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to segment mall customers for targeted marketing strategies.

### [Categorization Comparison](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Categorization_Comparison.ipynb)

Evaluated the performance of Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers in binary data classification scenarios.

### [Cancer Detection - CNN](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Cancer_Detection_CNN.ipynb)

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect cancer in medical images, contributing to medical diagnostics.

### [Disaster Tweets Analysis](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Disaster_Tweets_Analysis.ipynb)

Employed LSTM and GRU models to classify disaster-related tweets for efficient response during emergencies.

### [Text Generation with LSTM](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Text_Generation_with_LSTM.ipynb)

Implemented Character-Level Text Generation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), inspired by Nietzsche's work.

### [Supervised Text Classification for Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Supervised_Text_Classification_for_Marketing_Analytics.ipynb)

Created a deep learning algorithm using k-train to predict the probability of health and wellness topics in news stories for client Chrishare.

### [BBC News Classification](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/BBC_News_Classification.ipynb)

Developed an accurate classification system using Logistic Regression TF-IDF for categorizing news articles into business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech categories.

### [Monet-Style Image Generation using CycleGAN](https://github.com/Ndaniel455/DataSciencePortfolios/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Monet_Style_Image_Generation_using_CycleGAN.ipynb)

Explored the CycleGAN framework to generate Monet-style images, transforming photographs into Monet-esque paintings.
